# Aristocrat Substituter
Welcome to the Aristocrat Substituter! This program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages in the aristocrat cipher, based on a known key.
Essentially, you can send secret messages with a key that you can choose who to share with!

### If you wish to use Go:
1. Download the Go files
2. Run "go run encrypt/encrypt.go" to encrypt a message, and use a custom code with 1:1 alphabet substitution (aristocrat cipher)!
   Ex: If the key is: "hoeldk", in the coded message, any a's will become h, any b's will become o, any c's will become e, and so forth.

4. Run "go run decrypt/decrypt.go" to decrypt a message, using the key that you/ your friend used to create the coded message.

### If you wish to use Python:
1. Download the Python files
2. Run "python encrypt/encrypt.py" to encrypt a message, and use a custom code with 1:1 alphabet substitution (aristocrat cipher)!
   Ex: If the key is: "hoeldk", in the coded message, any a's will become h, any b's will become o, any c's will become e, and so forth.
